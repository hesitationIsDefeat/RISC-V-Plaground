# 🏗️ RISC-V Playground 🚀  

Welcome to **RISC-V Playground**, a dedicated space for exploring, documenting, and experimenting with the **RISC-V** instruction set architecture! 🎯  

---

## 🌟 What is this repository?  
This repository is my **personal research lab** for understanding **how RISC-V works from the ground up**—with the ultimate goal of **designing and building my own processor!** 🏗️⚡  

Here, I document my journey as I:  
✅ Study the **core principles** of RISC-V  
✅ Break down **registers, instructions, and execution pipelines**  
✅ Experiment with **assembly programming and CPU design**  
✅ Eventually **design a custom RISC-V processor!** 🏎️  

If you're also fascinated by **how computers truly work**, you're in the right place!
