# RISC-V Modules

RISC-V is a modular instruction set architecture (ISA) that allows custom extensions while maintaining a standard base set of instructions. The modular design includes various standard extensions that enhance the capabilities of the base ISA.

## Base Integer Instruction Sets
| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| RV32I / RV64I | Base integer instruction set for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Provides essential arithmetic, logical, load/store, and control flow instructions. |
| RV128I | Base integer instruction set for 128-bit architectures. Currently less common but designed for future scalability. |
| RV32E | A reduced version of RV32I, designed for embedded systems with fewer registers (only 16 general-purpose registers instead of 32). |

### Explanation
- **RV32I**: Defines a minimal but complete instruction set for 32-bit architectures, including basic operations such as addition, subtraction, logical operations, and jumps.
- **RV64I**: Expands RV32I with 64-bit registers and operations, enabling larger integer computations.
- **RV128I**: Further extends the architecture to 128-bit operations, primarily for future high-performance computing applications.
- **RV32E**: Tailored for embedded systems with reduced hardware complexity, using only 16 registers instead of 32 to save space and power.

## Standard Extensions
| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| M (Integer Multiplication and Division) | Adds support for integer multiplication and division instructions. |
| A (Atomic Instructions) | Provides atomic read-modify-write instructions for concurrency and synchronization. |
| F (Single-Precision Floating-Point) | Enables single-precision (32-bit) floating-point arithmetic operations. |
| D (Double-Precision Floating-Point) | Extends F with double-precision (64-bit) floating-point arithmetic. |
| Q (Quad-Precision Floating-Point) | Further extends floating-point capabilities with quad-precision (128-bit) operations. |
| C (Compressed Instructions) | Provides 16-bit compressed versions of frequently used instructions, reducing code size. |
| V (Vector Instructions) | Introduces SIMD-like vector processing for high-performance computing. |
| B (Bit-Manipulation) | Adds advanced bitwise operations to enhance performance in cryptographic and low-level bitwise computations. |
| T (Transactional Memory) | Enables transactional memory for speculative execution and memory consistency. |
| P (Packed SIMD) | Implements packed SIMD operations to accelerate multimedia and DSP applications. |

### Explanation
- **M Extension**: Used for efficient multiplication and division operations, crucial for performance in many applications.
- **A Extension**: Essential for multi-threaded environments where atomic operations help with concurrency.
- **F/D/Q Extensions**: Provide varying levels of floating-point precision, used in scientific computations and multimedia applications.
- **C Extension**: Helps in reducing memory footprint and power consumption by compressing instructions.
- **V Extension**: Provides high-speed parallel computation capabilities, beneficial for AI and data processing workloads.
- **B Extension**: Optimizes cryptographic and low-level bitwise operations for security and fast computations.
- **T Extension**: Improves multi-threaded execution by introducing transactional memory mechanisms.
- **P Extension**: Enables specialized SIMD processing for DSP and media applications.

## Privileged Architecture
| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| U (User Mode) | Provides unprivileged execution mode for applications. |
| S (Supervisor Mode) | Enables operating system-level features such as virtual memory and process management. |
| M (Machine Mode) | The highest privilege level, used for hardware control and low-level system management. |
| H (Hypervisor Mode) | Allows for virtualization by providing multiple guest OS environments. |

### Explanation
- **User Mode (U)**: Used for running application code in a restricted environment.
- **Supervisor Mode (S)**: Grants OS privileges for memory management and security enforcement.
- **Machine Mode (M)**: The most privileged mode, capable of accessing hardware registers and managing system initialization.
- **Hypervisor Mode (H)**: Facilitates virtualization, allowing multiple OS instances to run on the same hardware.

## Custom Extensions
RISC-V allows organizations and developers to define custom extensions suited to specific workloads. These extensions maintain compatibility with the base ISA while optimizing performance for specialized applications.
